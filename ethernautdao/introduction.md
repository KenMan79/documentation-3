# Introduction

## Welcome to the Ether, Ethernaut. <a id="da0b"></a>

The Ethereum ecosystem continues to grow at a staggering pace. Layer 2 solutions are finally here, the Eth2 merge is well under way, and DeFi adoption continues to rise. Things are stirring up for sure! To keep up with the pace, protocols need to scale engineering capacities. In spite of the phenomenal growth, there arenâ€™t enough qualified developers in the ecosystem for everything we need to build in the short to mid term. The issue at hand is that while there are millions of exceptionally skilled and experienced senior developers out there, senior _Solidity_ developers remain scarce.

The **Ethernauts**, developers already exploring the ether, seek out to solve this imbalance and flip the supply deficiency by combining their forces and knowledge. With the right incentives, we can rapidly transform senior developers into senior Solidity developers.
